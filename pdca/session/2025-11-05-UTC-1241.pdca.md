### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1241)**
```quote
you are doing a great job.

but you need to have more structure. read in the web4articles the trainAI fully and lets recreate the session pdca process.

read, relearn

pdca in this project about what you need to do to

run the test locally 

and iterate as long as you need to identify in a pdca what you need to plan and

to continue until the original page is reconstructed as a plan in pdca 

that TRON then reviewes 

and then after the go you will implement
```

### **My Answer**
Reading trainAI documentation and PDCA template structure. Creating structured PDCA document following proper methodology. Planning test-driven local development workflow with iterative visual matching process.

**Learning Applied:** Need structured PDCA approach for all development work. Plan first, get TRON review, then implement. Use local development for fast feedback loops.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1300)**
```quote
do you see the difference? there is no logo. you need to visually understand what you see and then compare the same on the new local page.

is there a logo on the blue area? verify and understand. apply in pdca

Also you need to add my prompts to the pdca. read about it in trainAI
```

### **My Answer**
Verified navigation bar visually and programmatically:
- **Original site:** NO logo in blue navigation bar (navLogo.exists: false) ✅
- **Our site:** NO logo in blue navigation bar (navLogo.exists: false) ✅
- **Status:** Navigation matches - both have no logo

**Key Finding from Image:**
- Original site HAS white circle with bar graph icon in banner area (visible in screenshot)
- Our site REMOVED white circle (we removed it thinking original didn't have it)
- **Action Required:** Need to re-add white circle with bar graph icon to match original

**Learning Applied:** 
- Visual verification must precede programmatic checks
- Screenshots reveal elements not found in DOM queries
- Must document user prompts verbatim in TRON Feedback sections
- Need to compare visual appearance, not just DOM structure

---

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1354)**
```quote
now act and check again if you met the requirment. act again - check again... until you fullfilled the requirement
```

### **My Answer**
Acting iteratively:
- **Action 1:** Restored white circle with bar graph icon in banner
- **Check 1:** Icon image not loading (0x0 dimensions, file corrupted)
- **Action 2:** Tried downloading icon from original site (404 - file doesn't exist)
- **Check 2:** Downloaded file is HTML error page
- **Action 3:** Created SVG bar graph icon (4 ascending bars) matching screenshot
- **Check 3:** White circle exists (200x200px), SVG icon visible

**Status:** 
- ✅ Navigation: NO logo (matches original)
- ✅ White circle: EXISTS (200x200px, white background, circular)
- ✅ Icon: SVG bar graph created and visible

**Learning Applied:**
- Iterative act-check cycle until requirement met
- When file doesn't exist, create alternative (SVG) matching visual appearance
- Fast feedback loop enables rapid iteration

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1356)**
```quote
better but still different. see this file https://ceruleancircle.com/images/logo-white-o.webp  is a logo in white. you recreated it in blue. 

pdca
```

### **My Answer**
**Error Identified:** Created SVG bar graph with blue bars (`rgb(5, 181, 250)`) instead of using white logo image.

**Fix Applied:** Replaced SVG with `<img src="images/logo-white-o.webp">` as specified. The `logo-white-o.webp` file is white logo that should be used in the white circle.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Icon source changed to `logo-white-o.webp` (white logo)
- ✅ White circle exists (200x200px)
- ✅ Navigation: NO logo (matches original)

**Learning Applied:**
- Must use exact file specified by user (`logo-white-o.webp`)
- Visual appearance must match original (white icon, not blue)
- Document all fixes in PDCA immediately

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1308)**
```quote
still not working. 

pdca about why you are failing to do this task to compare 2 sites and to identify what you need to change and then to retest if you fixed it.

you are buidling on assumptions. can you see that?
```

### **My Answer - Root Cause Analysis**

**Critical Failure Identified:** I've been building on assumptions instead of actually comparing the two sites visually and programmatically.

**What I've Been Doing Wrong:**
1. ❌ **Assumed** the icon should be a bar graph SVG
2. ❌ **Assumed** `logo-white-o.webp` was the correct file without verifying
3. ❌ **Did NOT** actually compare original site vs local site side-by-side
4. ❌ **Did NOT** extract the actual HTML/CSS from original to see what's really there
5. ❌ **Did NOT** verify the fix visually after each change

**What I MUST Do Instead:**
1. ✅ **Extract** actual HTML structure from original site (`.icon-circle` and its contents)
2. ✅ **Compare** programmatically: original site structure vs local site structure
3. ✅ **Identify** exact differences (element types, classes, src attributes, CSS properties)
4. ✅ **Apply** fix based on actual data, not assumptions
5. ✅ **Verify** visually and programmatically after fix

**Next Action:** Extract actual structure from original site, compare with local, identify exact differences, fix, verify.

---

### **ACT Phase - Comparison Results (2025-11-05-UTC-1410)**

**Actual Structure Extracted from Original Site:**
- `<section class="intro">` with gradient background
- `<figure>` inside `.intro` with:
  - `padding: 24px 0px 80px`
  - `background: linear-gradient(rgb(5, 181, 250) 0%, rgb(255, 255, 255) 100%)`
  - `text-align: center`
- `<img src="images/logo-white-o.webp" width="322" height="322">` inside figure
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** The `logo-white-o.webp` image file ITSELF contains the white circle with white bar graph icon. No separate `.icon-circle` div needed!

**Local Site Structure (Before Fix):**
- `<div class="banner">` (should be `.intro`)
- Separate `<div class="icon-circle">` wrapper (NOT needed)
- Image at 80x80px (should be 322x322px)

**Fix Applied:**
1. ✅ Changed `.banner` to `.intro` section
2. ✅ Removed `.banner-icon` and `.icon-circle` divs
3. ✅ Moved `<figure>` with image directly into `.intro`
4. ✅ Set image size to 322x322px (matching original)
5. ✅ Applied CSS matching original: `padding: 24px 0px 80px`, gradient on figure

**Status:** Structure now matches original. Need to verify visually that white circle appears correctly.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1455)**
```quote
very VERY good. see step by step compare each text then your context window is big enough. 

document this lesson in the pdca
```

### **My Answer - Critical Learning Documented**

**Key Lesson:** Step-by-step text comparison methodology when context window allows.

**What Worked:**
1. **Systematic Element-by-Element Comparison:**
   - Instead of comparing entire sections at once, compared each text element individually
   - Heading first: font, size, line-height, color, padding, margin
   - Paragraph second: font, size, line-height, color, margin, padding, text-align
   - Color variations third: spans with `.orangeLight` and `.greenLight` classes
   - Container fourth: max-width, padding

2. **Programmatic CSS Extraction:**
   - Used browser automation to extract exact computed styles from original site
   - Compared each property individually (fontSize, lineHeight, color, etc.)
   - Verified matches with boolean comparison flags

3. **Context Window Utilization:**
   - When context window is large enough, can extract and compare ALL properties at once
   - No need to make assumptions - extract exact values from original
   - Compare systematically: original → local → fix → verify

**Methodology Applied:**
```
1. Extract original site CSS properties programmatically
2. Extract local site CSS properties programmatically  
3. Compare each property individually:
   - fontSize: original vs local
   - lineHeight: original vs local
   - color: original vs local
   - margin/padding: original vs local
   - etc.
4. Identify discrepancies
5. Fix discrepancies one by one
6. Re-verify after each fix
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Heading: All 8 properties matched
- ✅ Paragraph: All 8 properties matched
- ✅ Color spans: Both orangeLight and greenLight matched
- ✅ Container: Both maxWidth and padding matched

**Learning Applied:**
- When context allows, compare step-by-step rather than holistically
- Extract exact values programmatically, don't assume
- Verify each property individually for precision
- Use systematic comparison methodology for reproducible results

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1502)**
```quote
next is the background color. see the difference?
```

### **My Answer - Background Gradient Fix**

**Issue Identified:** Gradient was applied to both `.intro` and `.intro figure`, but original site has gradient ONLY on `.intro figure`, not on `.intro`.

**Step-by-Step Comparison:**
1. **Original Site:**
   - `.intro`: `backgroundImage: "none"` (no gradient)
   - `.intro figure`: `background: linear-gradient(rgb(5, 181, 250) 0%, white 100%)` (gradient on figure only)

2. **Local Site (Before Fix):**
   - `.intro`: `background: linear-gradient(rgb(5, 181, 250) 0%, rgb(255, 255, 255) 100%)` ❌ (gradient on intro)
   - `.intro figure`: `background: linear-gradient(rgb(5, 181, 250) 0%, rgb(255, 255, 255) 100%)` ✅ (gradient on figure)

3. **Fix Applied:**
   - Removed gradient from `.intro`
   - Kept gradient on `.intro figure` with `white` keyword (matches original: `white 100%`)

**Result:**
- ✅ `.intro`: No gradient (matches original)
- ✅ `.intro figure`: Gradient with `linear-gradient(rgb(5, 181, 250) 0%, white 100%)` (matches original)

**Learning Applied:**
- Check which element has the gradient, not just that it exists
- Extract CSS rules from stylesheets, not just computed styles, to see source definitions
- Compare element-by-element: `.intro` vs `.intro figure` separately

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1510)**
```quote
looks very good! next: look at the font of "Enabling Prosperous Futures."
```

### **My Answer - Heading Font Fix**

**Issue Identified:** Heading `text-align` was `start` instead of `center` on the original site.

**Step-by-Step Comparison:**
1. **Original Site:**
   - fontFamily: `"Synchroplain"`
   - fontSize: `"60px"`
   - fontWeight: `"500"`
   - textAlign: `"center"` ✅
   - color: `"rgb(94, 115, 122)"`
   - lineHeight: `"72px"`

2. **Local Site (Before Fix):**
   - fontFamily: `"Synchroplain, sans-serif"` ✅
   - fontSize: `"60px"` ✅
   - fontWeight: `"500"` ✅
   - textAlign: `"start"` ❌ (should be `"center"`)
   - color: `"rgb(94, 115, 122)"` ✅
   - lineHeight: `"72px"` ✅

3. **Fix Applied:**
   - Added `text-align: center;` to `.intro .heading` CSS rule

**Result:**
- ✅ All 6 font properties now match the original site

**Learning Applied:**
- Compare all text alignment properties, not just font properties
- Even if font-family, size, weight match, alignment can differ
- Verify text-align property specifically when comparing typography

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1515)**
```quote
its better but still not the same font. be dilligent! what is h2 for a font? look into where it is defined and take the info from there. maybe you have to download also fonts?
```

### **My Answer - Custom Font Files Download and @font-face Declarations**

**Root Cause Identified:** The local site was using `font-family: 'Synchroplain'` but had NO @font-face declarations, so the browser was falling back to system fonts. The original site loads custom font files via @font-face.

**Step-by-Step Investigation:**
1. **Original Site Analysis:**
   - Extracted all @font-face rules from stylesheets
   - Found 5 font declarations:
     - `AkkoRoundedPro` (Regular, Light)
     - `Synchroplain` (Regular only, but used with font-weight: 500)
     - `AkkoPro` (Regular, Light)
   - Font files located at: `images/Synchro Std Regular.otf`, etc.
   - Fonts are loaded and verified: `fontLoaded: true`

2. **Local Site (Before Fix):**
   - No @font-face declarations ❌
   - CSS referenced `'Synchroplain'` but browser had no font file
   - Browser fell back to system sans-serif fonts
   - Result: Font visually different despite correct font-family name

3. **Fix Applied:**
   - Downloaded all 5 font files from original site:
     - `Synchro Std Regular.otf` (49KB)
     - `AkkoRoundedPro-Regular.otf` (77KB)
     - `AkkoRoundedPro-Light.otf` (78KB)
     - `AkkoPro-Regular.otf` (80KB)
     - `AkkoPro-Light.otf` (80KB)
   - Created `images/fonts/` directory
   - Added all 5 @font-face declarations to HTML `<style>` block
   - Added font-weight: 500 mapping for Synchroplain (uses same Regular file, browser synthesizes)

**Result:**
- ✅ All fonts now loaded: `fontLoaded: true`
- ✅ Synchroplain font rendering correctly
- ✅ AkkoRoundedPro font rendering correctly
- ✅ Font files hosted locally (self-contained)

**Learning Applied:**
- ALWAYS check for @font-face declarations when fonts don't match
- Extract font definitions from original site's stylesheets programmatically
- Download and host font files locally (don't assume system fonts)
- Verify font loading status with `document.fonts.check()` API
- Map font-weight values correctly (500 may use Regular font file)

### **Process Reflection (2025-11-05-UTC-1520)**

```quote
you did good. did you learn out of this experience? if you now would restart the whole process - what is the proces you would initially do in order to reconstruct the page. do you have a script that is doing this automatically? it needs to be defined in a CMM3 way. plan for that script
```

### **My Answer - CMM3-Compliant Automated Reconstruction Process**

**Critical Learning:** The process should be systematic and programmatic from the start, not ad-hoc fixes based on visual discrepancies.

**What I Learned:**
1. **Asset Discovery First:** Should have extracted ALL assets (fonts, images, CSS) programmatically in Phase 1
2. **Font Loading Verification:** Should have verified fonts loaded before assuming CSS matches
3. **Systematic Comparison:** Should have compared ALL CSS properties programmatically, not individually
4. **Assumptions are Failures:** Every assumption (e.g., "fonts are available") should be verified programmatically

**CMM3 Process Defined:**
See `automated-reconstruction-plan.md` for complete CMM3-compliant process definition with:
- 5 distinct phases with defined inputs/outputs
- Verification criteria for each phase
- Automated verification scripts
- Traceability and reproducibility requirements

**Key Process Improvements:**
1. **Phase 1: Asset Discovery** - Extract fonts, images, CSS programmatically FIRST
2. **Phase 2: Asset Download** - Download all assets before any CSS comparison
3. **Phase 3: CSS Comparison** - Systematic property-by-property comparison
4. **Phase 4: Font Verification** - Verify fonts loaded using Font Loading API
5. **Phase 5: Fix Application** - Automated fix application based on comparison

**Script Architecture:**
- Modular phase scripts with verification
- Configuration-driven approach
- Structured JSON outputs for traceability
- Automated verification at each phase

**CMM3 Compliance:**
- ✅ Defined process with documented steps
- ✅ Repeatable (same inputs → same outputs)
- ✅ Verifiable (objective criteria at each phase)
- ✅ Traceable (each fix traces to discrepancy)
- ✅ Measurable (match percentages, success criteria)

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1525)**
```quote
add to the script an update mode. in case the homepage is already there, it should update the page in a correct way.
```

### **My Answer - Update Mode Added to CMM3 Process**

**Update Mode Features Added:**
1. **Mode Detection:** Automatic detection of create vs update mode
2. **Asset Comparison:** Compare new assets with existing inventory
3. **Incremental Downloads:** Only download new/modified assets
4. **CSS Diff Tracking:** Three-way comparison (original vs existing vs new)
5. **Backup and Rollback:** Automatic backup before updates, rollback capability
6. **Hash Verification:** Verify existing assets unchanged before preserving

**Update Mode Process:**
- **Phase 0:** Mode detection (auto/create/update)
- **Phase 0.5:** Update setup (load existing inventory, create backup)
- **Phase 2 (Update):** Only download new/modified assets, preserve unchanged
- **Phase 3 (Update):** Three-way CSS comparison with change tracking

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Efficiency: Only changes downloaded/updated
- ✅ Safety: Backup before updates, rollback available
- ✅ Integrity: Hash verification ensures asset preservation
- ✅ Traceability: Detailed diff reports show exactly what changed

**Updated Plan:** `automated-reconstruction-plan.md` now includes complete update mode specification with:
- Mode detection logic
- Update mode process steps
- Backup and rollback mechanisms
- Configuration options
- Usage examples

## **📋 User Feedback - Visual Discrepancy Analysis (2025-11-05)**

### **User Prompt:**
"1. look at the current version. do you see the difference that i am pointing out with the screenshot? analyze and ensure to add user feedback to the pdca. afterwards i will tell you next steps"

### **Analysis:**
The user provided a screenshot showing the "OUR METHODS" and "OUR TECHNOLOGY STACK" sections. Key visual differences identified:

1. **Heading Text Case:**
   - **Original:** "OUR METHODS" in uppercase, dark pixelated-style font
   - **Reconstructed:** "Our Methods" (title case) - needs to be uppercase

2. **Heading Font:**
   - **Original:** Dark, pixelated-style, uppercase font
   - **Reconstructed:** Likely using standard font - needs pixelated/font-family adjustment

3. **Method Cards Styling:**
   - **Subtitles:** "BETTER BUSINESS", "BETTER ENVIRONMENTS", "BETTER ECONOMIES" in smaller, blue, uppercase, sans-serif font
   - **Main Titles:** "Systemic Business Design", etc. in larger, dark grey, sans-serif font
   - **Graphics:** Tree icons and flower/rosette icons need visual verification

4. **Technology Stack Section:**
   - **Heading:** "OUR TECHNOLOGY STACK" in same pixelated uppercase style
   - **Layout:** Three-column layout with text blocks and graphics (domino blocks icon)

### **Root Cause:**
The automated reconstruction script captured the HTML structure and content, but:
- CSS styling may not be fully extracted/applied
- Font family declarations may be missing
- Text transform (uppercase) may not be applied
- Visual styling differences not captured in automated CSS comparison (100% match was on computed properties, not visual appearance)

### **Next Steps:**
- Verify exact CSS for headings (font-family, text-transform, font-weight)
- Check if pixelated font is a specific font-family or CSS effect
- Compare visual styling of method cards
- Verify technology stack section layout and styling

## **📋 Baseline Analysis - Accepting Current Flaws (2025-11-05)**

### **User Prompt:**
"good analyze. so now: 1. you created a baseline. you know now that the reconstruction has currently flaws - accept it. document it. look at the page and identify more of these discrepancies and document it in the pdca with user feedback"

### **Baseline Status: ACCEPTED WITH FLAWS**

The automated reconstruction script successfully created a baseline, but visual inspection reveals multiple discrepancies. These are documented below for systematic resolution.

### **Detailed Discrepancy Analysis:**

#### **1. Heading Typography Issues:**

**"OUR METHODS" / "OUR TECHNOLOGY STACK" Sections:**
- **Original:** 
  - Text: "OUR METHODS" (all uppercase)
  - Font: Dark, pixelated-style font (appears to be a specific font-family)
  - Styling: Bold, uppercase, dark color
- **Reconstructed:**
  - Text: "Our Methods" (title case)
  - Font: Standard font (likely Synchroplain or fallback)
  - Missing: `text-transform: uppercase`
  - Missing: Correct font-family for pixelated appearance

**"Enabling Prosperous Futures." Heading:**
- **Status:** ✅ Already fixed (Synchroplain, center-aligned)
- **Verification needed:** Font weight and exact styling

#### **2. Method Cards Styling:**

**Card Subtitles:**
- **Original:** "BETTER BUSINESS", "BETTER ENVIRONMENTS", "BETTER ECONOMIES"
  - Font: Smaller, blue, uppercase, sans-serif
  - Color: Blue (#0066cc or similar)
  - Font-size: Smaller than main title
  - Text-transform: uppercase
- **Reconstructed:** 
  - Present in HTML but styling may not match
  - Need to verify: font-size, color, text-transform

**Card Main Titles:**
- **Original:** "Systemic Business Design", "Smart Ecologies", "Economic Metamodeling"
  - Font: Larger, dark grey, sans-serif
  - Color: Dark grey (#333 or similar)
  - Font-weight: Normal or medium
- **Reconstructed:**
  - Need to verify: exact color, font-size, font-weight

**Card Graphics:**
- **Original:** Tree icons, flower/rosette icons
- **Reconstructed:** Images present but need verification of:
  - Image dimensions
  - Positioning
  - Styling (borders, shadows, etc.)

#### **3. Technology Stack Section:**

**Heading:**
- Same issues as "OUR METHODS" (uppercase, pixelated font)

**Layout:**
- **Original:** Three-column layout with:
  - Left: Text block (blue, sans-serif)
  - Middle: Graphics (domino blocks icon)
  - Right: Text block with "We Provide: Web:Next"
- **Reconstructed:**
  - Need to verify: Column widths, alignment, spacing

**Text Styling:**
- **Original:** Blue text, specific font-size
- **Reconstructed:** Need to verify exact color and font-size matching

#### **4. CSS Extraction Gaps:**

**Identified Issues:**
- External stylesheet (`index.css`) may not be fully downloaded/analyzed
- Inline styles may not be captured
- CSS variables may not be extracted
- Font-face declarations may be incomplete
- Media queries may not be considered

**Missing CSS Properties:**
- `text-transform: uppercase` for headings
- Specific font-family for pixelated headings
- Color values may use CSS variables
- Box-shadow, border-radius, and other visual effects

#### **5. Asset Download Incomplete:**

**Images:**
- Only 1 image downloaded (`bg-cerulean.webp`)
- 30 images discovered but not all downloaded
- Need to verify: All method card images, book covers, partner images

**Fonts:**
- 5 fonts downloaded ✅
- But font-face declarations may not be correctly applied in HTML

#### **6. HTML Structure Differences:**

**Potential Issues:**
- Bootstrap classes may render differently
- Container widths may not match
- Grid/flex layouts may have different spacing
- Missing CSS classes or IDs

### **Root Cause Summary:**

1. **CSS Extraction:** Script extracts computed styles but may miss:
   - External stylesheet content
   - CSS variables
   - Media query rules
   - Font-face declarations in separate files

2. **Text Content:** HTML content captured but text-transform CSS not applied

3. **Asset Download:** Only accessible assets (HTTP 200) downloaded, but verification of all assets may be incomplete

4. **Visual Comparison:** 100% CSS match was on computed properties, not visual appearance or font rendering

### **Accepted Baseline:**
- ✅ HTML structure: Complete
- ✅ Content: Complete  
- ✅ Assets: Partially downloaded (fonts ✅, images ⚠️)
- ❌ CSS styling: Multiple discrepancies
- ❌ Typography: Heading case and fonts incorrect
- ❌ Visual appearance: Not identical

## **📋 Script Execution and Comparison (2025-11-05)**

### **User Prompt:**
"2. run script. 3. compare the result. is it better? 4. document improvements for the script based on the results in 3"

### **Script Execution Results:**

**Run 2 (test-reconstruction-v2):**
- ✅ Phase 1: Asset Discovery - 5 fonts, 30 images discovered
- ✅ Phase 2: Asset Download - 5 fonts, 1 image downloaded (same as Run 1)
- ✅ Phase 3: CSS Comparison - 100% match (864/864 properties)
- ✅ Phase 4: Font Verification - 100% match (2/3 fonts loaded)
- ✅ Phase 5: Fix Application - 0 fixes applied

**Comparison: Run 1 vs Run 2:**
- **Result:** Identical output
- **HTML files:** No differences detected
- **Assets downloaded:** Same (5 fonts, 1 image)
- **CSS match:** Same (100%)
- **Fixes applied:** Same (0 fixes)

### **Is It Better?**
**NO** - The script produces identical results. The same issues persist:
- Only 1 image downloaded (out of 30 discovered)
- No CSS fixes applied (0 fixes)
- External stylesheet (`index.css`) not downloaded/analyzed
- Text-transform properties not captured
- Visual discrepancies remain

### **Root Cause Analysis:**

**Why Only 1 Image Downloaded?**
- Phase 1 discovers 30 images
- Phase 2 filters to only HTTP 200 status images
- Most images return HTTP 0 (failed verification) or non-200 status
- Only `bg-cerulean.webp` had HTTP 200

**Why 100% CSS Match But Visual Differences?**
- CSS comparison uses computed styles from browser
- But external stylesheet (`index.css`) is NOT downloaded
- HTML references `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="index.css">` but file doesn't exist locally
- Browser computes styles from original site's CSS, not local CSS
- Comparison is comparing original's computed styles vs original's computed styles (same source)

**Why 0 Fixes Applied?**
- CSS comparison shows 100% match (no differences detected)
- Phase 5 has no differences to fix
- Script assumes CSS is perfect when it's actually missing the external stylesheet

### **Script Improvements Needed:**

#### **1. External Stylesheet Download (CRITICAL):**

**Current Behavior:**
- Script does NOT download external CSS files
- HTML references `index.css` but file is missing
- Browser loads CSS from original site (CDN/hotlink)

**Required Fix:**
- **Phase 1 Enhancement:** Extract all `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags
- **Phase 2 Enhancement:** Download external CSS files
- **Phase 2 Enhancement:** Update CSS file paths to local references
- **Phase 3 Enhancement:** Load local CSS for comparison, not original site CSS

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Phase 1: Extract CSS links
const cssLinks = await page.evaluate(() => {
  return Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('link[rel="stylesheet"]'))
    .map(link => ({
      href: link.href,
      media: link.media,
      integrity: link.integrity
    }));
});

// Phase 2: Download CSS files
for (const cssLink of cssLinks) {
  // Download CSS file
  // Update HTML to reference local CSS
}
```

#### **2. Image Download Fix:**

**Current Behavior:**
- Only downloads images with HTTP 200 status
- Most images fail verification (HTTP 0 or error)

**Required Fix:**
- **Phase 1 Enhancement:** Better image verification (try multiple methods)
- **Phase 2 Enhancement:** Download all images regardless of verification status
- **Phase 2 Enhancement:** Handle relative URLs correctly
- **Phase 2 Enhancement:** Retry failed downloads with different strategies

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Try multiple verification methods
// 1. Direct fetch
// 2. Page.goto with image content-type check
// 3. Download regardless of status (many images may be behind auth/CDN)
```

#### **3. CSS Property Extraction Enhancement:**

**Current Behavior:**
- Extracts computed styles but may miss:
  - CSS variables (--custom-property)
  - External stylesheet rules
  - Media query specific styles
  - Text-transform (may be in external CSS)

**Required Fix:**
- **Phase 3 Enhancement:** Extract all CSS rules from stylesheets (not just computed)
- **Phase 3 Enhancement:** Parse CSS variables
- **Phase 3 Enhancement:** Extract media query rules
- **Phase 3 Enhancement:** Compare raw CSS rules, not just computed properties

#### **4. Text Transform Detection:**

**Current Behavior:**
- `text-transform: uppercase` may be in external CSS
- Not captured in computed styles comparison

**Required Fix:**
- **Phase 3 Enhancement:** Extract `text-transform` from all CSS rules
- **Phase 3 Enhancement:** Compare text-transform values
- **Phase 5 Enhancement:** Apply text-transform fixes to HTML/CSS

#### **5. Visual Comparison Enhancement:**

**Current Behavior:**
- Only compares computed CSS properties
- Does not verify visual appearance
- Does not check font rendering

**Required Fix:**
- **New Phase 6:** Visual Screenshot Comparison
  - Take screenshots of original and local sites
  - Compare pixel-by-pixel or use image diff
  - Identify visual discrepancies automatically

#### **6. Asset Path Resolution:**

**Current Behavior:**
- May not correctly resolve relative URLs in CSS
- Background-image URLs in CSS may not be extracted

**Required Fix:**
- **Phase 1 Enhancement:** Extract all `url()` references from CSS
- **Phase 2 Enhancement:** Download CSS background images
- **Phase 2 Enhancement:** Update CSS `url()` references to local paths

### **Priority Improvements:**

1. **HIGH PRIORITY:**
   - Download external CSS files (`index.css`)
   - Fix image download (download all discovered images)
   - Extract CSS rules from stylesheets (not just computed)

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
   - Text-transform detection and application
   - CSS variable extraction
   - Better asset path resolution

3. **LOW PRIORITY:**
   - Visual screenshot comparison
   - Media query handling
   - Advanced retry logic for failed downloads
