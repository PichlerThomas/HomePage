**TEMPLATE VERIFICATION: Template version 3.2.4.2 verified from Web4Articles/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md**

- [ ] **Local Development Workflow**: Verify local server setup and fast feedback loop methodology
- [ ] **Test-Driven Approach**: Confirm test-first planning before implementation
- [ ] **Visual Matching Criteria**: Define objective criteria for visual comparison
- [ ] **Iteration Plan**: Approve iterative development cycle until visual match achieved
- [ ] **Implementation Approval**: Review complete plan before execution phase

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1241)**
```quote
you are doing a great job.

but you need to have more structure. read in the web4articles the trainAI fully and lets recreate the session pdca process.

read, relearn

pdca in this project about what you need to do to

run the test locally 

and iterate as long as you need to identify in a pdca what you need to plan and

to continue until the original page is reconstructed as a plan in pdca 

that TRON then reviewes 

and then after the go you will implement
```

### **My Answer**
Reading trainAI documentation and PDCA template structure. Creating structured PDCA document following proper methodology. Planning test-driven local development workflow with iterative visual matching process.

**Learning Applied:** Need structured PDCA approach for all development work. Plan first, get TRON review, then implement. Use local development for fast feedback loops.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1300)**
```quote
do you see the difference? there is no logo. you need to visually understand what you see and then compare the same on the new local page.

is there a logo on the blue area? verify and understand. apply in pdca

Also you need to add my prompts to the pdca. read about it in trainAI
```

### **My Answer**
Verified navigation bar visually and programmatically:
- **Original site:** NO logo in blue navigation bar (navLogo.exists: false) ✅
- **Our site:** NO logo in blue navigation bar (navLogo.exists: false) ✅
- **Status:** Navigation matches - both have no logo

**Key Finding from Image:**
- Original site HAS white circle with bar graph icon in banner area (visible in screenshot)
- Our site REMOVED white circle (we removed it thinking original didn't have it)
- **Action Required:** Need to re-add white circle with bar graph icon to match original

**Learning Applied:** 
- Visual verification must precede programmatic checks
- Screenshots reveal elements not found in DOM queries
- Must document user prompts verbatim in TRON Feedback sections
- Need to compare visual appearance, not just DOM structure

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1354)**
```quote
now act and check again if you met the requirment. act again - check again... until you fullfilled the requirement
```

### **My Answer**
Acting iteratively:
- **Action 1:** Restored white circle with bar graph icon in banner
- **Check 1:** Icon image not loading (0x0 dimensions, file corrupted)
- **Action 2:** Tried downloading icon from original site (404 - file doesn't exist)
- **Check 2:** Downloaded file is HTML error page
- **Action 3:** Created SVG bar graph icon (4 ascending bars) matching screenshot
- **Check 3:** White circle exists (200x200px), SVG icon visible

**Status:** 
- ✅ Navigation: NO logo (matches original)
- ✅ White circle: EXISTS (200x200px, white background, circular)
- ✅ Icon: SVG bar graph created and visible

**Learning Applied:**
- Iterative act-check cycle until requirement met
- When file doesn't exist, create alternative (SVG) matching visual appearance
- Fast feedback loop enables rapid iteration

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1356)**
```quote
better but still different. see this file https://ceruleancircle.com/images/logo-white-o.webp  is a logo in white. you recreated it in blue. 

pdca
```

### **My Answer**
**Error Identified:** Created SVG bar graph with blue bars (`rgb(5, 181, 250)`) instead of using white logo image.

**Fix Applied:** Replaced SVG with `<img src="images/logo-white-o.webp">` as specified. The `logo-white-o.webp` file is white logo that should be used in the white circle.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Icon source changed to `logo-white-o.webp` (white logo)
- ✅ White circle exists (200x200px)
- ✅ Navigation: NO logo (matches original)

**Learning Applied:**
- Must use exact file specified by user (`logo-white-o.webp`)
- Visual appearance must match original (white icon, not blue)
- Document all fixes in PDCA immediately

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1308)**
```quote
still not working. 

pdca about why you are failing to do this task to compare 2 sites and to identify what you need to change and then to retest if you fixed it.

you are buidling on assumptions. can you see that?
```

### **My Answer - Root Cause Analysis**

**Critical Failure Identified:** I've been building on assumptions instead of actually comparing the two sites visually and programmatically.

**What I've Been Doing Wrong:**
1. ❌ **Assumed** the icon should be a bar graph SVG
2. ❌ **Assumed** `logo-white-o.webp` was the correct file without verifying
3. ❌ **Did NOT** actually compare original site vs local site side-by-side
4. ❌ **Did NOT** extract the actual HTML/CSS from original to see what's really there
5. ❌ **Did NOT** verify the fix visually after each change

**What I MUST Do Instead:**
1. ✅ **Extract** actual HTML structure from original site (`.icon-circle` and its contents)
2. ✅ **Compare** programmatically: original site structure vs local site structure
3. ✅ **Identify** exact differences (element types, classes, src attributes, CSS properties)
4. ✅ **Apply** fix based on actual data, not assumptions
5. ✅ **Verify** visually and programmatically after fix

**Next Action:** Extract actual structure from original site, compare with local, identify exact differences, fix, verify.

---

### **ACT Phase - Comparison Results (2025-11-05-UTC-1410)**

**Actual Structure Extracted from Original Site:**
- `<section class="intro">` with gradient background
- `<figure>` inside `.intro` with:
  - `padding: 24px 0px 80px`
  - `background: linear-gradient(rgb(5, 181, 250) 0%, rgb(255, 255, 255) 100%)`
  - `text-align: center`
- `<img src="images/logo-white-o.webp" width="322" height="322">` inside figure
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** The `logo-white-o.webp` image file ITSELF contains the white circle with white bar graph icon. No separate `.icon-circle` div needed!

**Local Site Structure (Before Fix):**
- `<div class="banner">` (should be `.intro`)
- Separate `<div class="icon-circle">` wrapper (NOT needed)
- Image at 80x80px (should be 322x322px)

**Fix Applied:**
1. ✅ Changed `.banner` to `.intro` section
2. ✅ Removed `.banner-icon` and `.icon-circle` divs
3. ✅ Moved `<figure>` with image directly into `.intro`
4. ✅ Set image size to 322x322px (matching original)
5. ✅ Applied CSS matching original: `padding: 24px 0px 80px`, gradient on figure

**Status:** Structure now matches original. Need to verify visually that white circle appears correctly.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1455)**
```quote
very VERY good. see step by step compare each text then your context window is big enough. 

document this lesson in the pdca
```

### **My Answer - Critical Learning Documented**

**Key Lesson:** Step-by-step text comparison methodology when context window allows.

**What Worked:**
1. **Systematic Element-by-Element Comparison:**
   - Instead of comparing entire sections at once, compared each text element individually
   - Heading first: font, size, line-height, color, padding, margin
   - Paragraph second: font, size, line-height, color, margin, padding, text-align
   - Color variations third: spans with `.orangeLight` and `.greenLight` classes
   - Container fourth: max-width, padding

2. **Programmatic CSS Extraction:**
   - Used browser automation to extract exact computed styles from original site
   - Compared each property individually (fontSize, lineHeight, color, etc.)
   - Verified matches with boolean comparison flags

3. **Context Window Utilization:**
   - When context window is large enough, can extract and compare ALL properties at once
   - No need to make assumptions - extract exact values from original
   - Compare systematically: original → local → fix → verify

**Methodology Applied:**
```
1. Extract original site CSS properties programmatically
2. Extract local site CSS properties programmatically  
3. Compare each property individually:
   - fontSize: original vs local
   - lineHeight: original vs local
   - color: original vs local
   - margin/padding: original vs local
   - etc.
4. Identify discrepancies
5. Fix discrepancies one by one
6. Re-verify after each fix
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Heading: All 8 properties matched
- ✅ Paragraph: All 8 properties matched
- ✅ Color spans: Both orangeLight and greenLight matched
- ✅ Container: Both maxWidth and padding matched

**Learning Applied:**
- When context allows, compare step-by-step rather than holistically
- Extract exact values programmatically, don't assume
- Verify each property individually for precision
- Use systematic comparison methodology for reproducible results

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1502)**
```quote
next is the background color. see the difference?
```

### **My Answer - Background Gradient Fix**

**Issue Identified:** Gradient was applied to both `.intro` and `.intro figure`, but original site has gradient ONLY on `.intro figure`, not on `.intro`.

**Step-by-Step Comparison:**
1. **Original Site:**
   - `.intro`: `backgroundImage: "none"` (no gradient)
   - `.intro figure`: `background: linear-gradient(rgb(5, 181, 250) 0%, white 100%)` (gradient on figure only)

2. **Local Site (Before Fix):**
   - `.intro`: `background: linear-gradient(rgb(5, 181, 250) 0%, rgb(255, 255, 255) 100%)` ❌ (gradient on intro)
   - `.intro figure`: `background: linear-gradient(rgb(5, 181, 250) 0%, rgb(255, 255, 255) 100%)` ✅ (gradient on figure)

3. **Fix Applied:**
   - Removed gradient from `.intro`
   - Kept gradient on `.intro figure` with `white` keyword (matches original: `white 100%`)

**Result:**
- ✅ `.intro`: No gradient (matches original)
- ✅ `.intro figure`: Gradient with `linear-gradient(rgb(5, 181, 250) 0%, white 100%)` (matches original)

**Learning Applied:**
- Check which element has the gradient, not just that it exists
- Extract CSS rules from stylesheets, not just computed styles, to see source definitions
- Compare element-by-element: `.intro` vs `.intro figure` separately

```quote
looks very good! next: look at the font of "Enabling Prosperous Futures."
```

### **My Answer - Heading Font Fix**

**Issue Identified:** Heading `text-align` was `start` instead of `center` on the original site.

**Step-by-Step Comparison:**
1. **Original Site:**
   - fontFamily: `"Synchroplain"`
   - fontSize: `"60px"`
   - fontWeight: `"500"`
   - textAlign: `"center"` ✅
   - color: `"rgb(94, 115, 122)"`
   - lineHeight: `"72px"`

2. **Local Site (Before Fix):**
   - fontFamily: `"Synchroplain, sans-serif"` ✅
   - fontSize: `"60px"` ✅
   - fontWeight: `"500"` ✅
   - textAlign: `"start"` ❌ (should be `"center"`)
   - color: `"rgb(94, 115, 122)"` ✅
   - lineHeight: `"72px"` ✅

3. **Fix Applied:**
   - Added `text-align: center;` to `.intro .heading` CSS rule

**Result:**
- ✅ All 6 font properties now match the original site

**Learning Applied:**
- Compare all text alignment properties, not just font properties
- Even if font-family, size, weight match, alignment can differ
- Verify text-align property specifically when comparing typography

### **TRON Feedback (2025-11-05-UTC-1515)**
```quote
its better but still not the same font. be dilligent! what is h2 for a font? look into where it is defined and take the info from there. maybe you have to download also fonts?
```

### **My Answer - Custom Font Files Download and @font-face Declarations**

**Root Cause Identified:** The local site was using `font-family: 'Synchroplain'` but had NO @font-face declarations, so the browser was falling back to system fonts. The original site loads custom font files via @font-face.

**Step-by-Step Investigation:**
1. **Original Site Analysis:**
   - Extracted all @font-face rules from stylesheets
   - Found 5 font declarations:
     - `AkkoRoundedPro` (Regular, Light)
     - `Synchroplain` (Regular only, but used with font-weight: 500)
     - `AkkoPro` (Regular, Light)
   - Font files located at: `images/Synchro Std Regular.otf`, etc.
   - Fonts are loaded and verified: `fontLoaded: true`

2. **Local Site (Before Fix):**
   - No @font-face declarations ❌
   - CSS referenced `'Synchroplain'` but browser had no font file
   - Browser fell back to system sans-serif fonts
   - Result: Font visually different despite correct font-family name

3. **Fix Applied:**
   - Downloaded all 5 font files from original site:
     - `Synchro Std Regular.otf` (49KB)
     - `AkkoRoundedPro-Regular.otf` (77KB)
     - `AkkoRoundedPro-Light.otf` (78KB)
     - `AkkoPro-Regular.otf` (80KB)
     - `AkkoPro-Light.otf` (80KB)
   - Created `images/fonts/` directory
   - Added all 5 @font-face declarations to HTML `<style>` block
   - Added font-weight: 500 mapping for Synchroplain (uses same Regular file, browser synthesizes)

**Result:**
- ✅ All fonts now loaded: `fontLoaded: true`
- ✅ Synchroplain font rendering correctly
- ✅ AkkoRoundedPro font rendering correctly
- ✅ Font files hosted locally (self-contained)

**Learning Applied:**
- ALWAYS check for @font-face declarations when fonts don't match
- Extract font definitions from original site's stylesheets programmatically
- Download and host font files locally (don't assume system fonts)
- Verify font loading status with `document.fonts.check()` API
- Map font-weight values correctly (500 may use Regular font file)
